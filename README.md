***Course Project for Geographical Modeling and Geographic Computing***
### Source code & Data
The two .ipynb files correspond to the experimental groups' codes and results in the two experimental situations mentioned in the paper.
While data2.xlsx is the experimental data for Black Creek-1.ipynb, data.csv is for CSDN Wind-1.ipynb. Besides, wash_data.ipynb shows the method and process of data washing.
### Pre-trained model parameters
Readers could fetch the pre-trained model parameters in release v0.0.1.
### Model Network
The structure of the model in Black Creek-1.ipynb is shown in model_attention.png.
